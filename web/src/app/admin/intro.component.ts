      This is Arenadata Cluster Manager (ADCM) - the home of all your data. It connects together different data applications, providing a fast, reliable and enterprise-ready way to
      manage your data landscape. Please read this short notice to start use ADCM in its most efficient way.

    <h3>Bundle</h3>
    <p>
      Bundle is a set of functionality that you can add to your ADCM. Every data application (Database, Hadoop cluster, etc.) is created using a bundle. For example, to start a
      Hadoop cluster version 3.0.0, you will need a Hadoop 3.0.0 bundle. Other bundles may contain virtual machine access method (Amazon, Google, etc.), widgets, etc. Think of it
      like a plugin, or a mobile phone application.
    </p>
    <h3>Cluster</h3>
    <p>
      This is the main functionality. Cluster is a set of hosts, running one distributed application. Cluster is deployed from bundle. Of course, you can have multiple clusters set
      up from the same bundle.
    </p>
    <h3>Service</h3>
    <p>
      Service is a part of a cluster. It contain part of the cluster functionality. Service can run across all hosts in the cluster, or only across some of them.
    </p>
    <h3>Component</h3>
    <p>
      Component is a part of a service that is running on one host.
    </p>
    <h3>Hostprovider</h3>
    <p>
      Hostprovider is a set of access credentials for ADCM to create new hosts or access existing, For example, when you want to create a VM in a public cloud, you will need to add
      username, access key and other access credentials to ADCM. Do it by creating a new Hostprovider and editing its config.
    </p>
    <h3>Host</h3>
    <p>
      This is a machine that your data app is running on. A host may be a virtual machine, a physical server, or something else.<br/>
      A host can be added to only one cluster - you cannot share a host between multiple clusters.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    Shortly:
    <ul>
      <li>Bundle is a packet with functionality (ex. Hadoop)</li>
      <li>Cluster is a logical set of functionality. Cluster is created from bundle (ex Hadoop cluster)</li>
      <li>Service is a logical part of cluster (ex. HDFS)</li>
      <li>Component is a part of service, that is located on some host (ex. DataNode)</li>
    </ul>

    Now you are ready to start exploring ADCM by yourself - enjoy it!
